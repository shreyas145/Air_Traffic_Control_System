# Air_Traffic_Control_System
A project to focus on the concurrency and normalization aspect of database systems. We maintained a database to keep track of the arrival and departure of planes while ensuring that planes cannot land or leave for an interval of 5 minutes after each arrival and departure.
The schema is BCNF normalized.
